	abstract = {Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) can indicate inbreeding, population stratification, and even problems in genotyping. In samples of affected individuals, these deviations can also provide evidence for association. Tests of HWE are commonly performed using a simple χ2 goodness-of-fit test. We show that this χ2 test can have inflated type I error rates, even in relatively large samples (e.g., samples of 1,000 individuals that include ∼100 copies of the minor allele). On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation. Our methods adequately control type I error in large and small samples and are computationally efficient. They have been implemented in freely available code that will be useful for quality assessment of genotype data and for the detection of genetic association or population stratification in very large data sets.},

	abstract = {[A family of species diversity measures proposed by Hurlbert (1971) is defined as the expected number of species in a random sample of m individuals from a population. For m = 2 this measure is equivalent to Simpson's diversity index. For larger m, the measure is increasingly sensitive to rare species. In this paper we use unbiased estimation theory to obtain a minimum variance unbiased estimator for this family of diversity measures. An unbiased estimator of the sampling variance is also obtained. These results are then used to partition the variation in sample diversity between random sampling error and local variation community diversity.]},

	abstract = {The recent literature on species diversity contains many semantic, conceptual, and technical problems. It is suggested that, as a result of these problems, species diversity has become a meaningless concept, that the term be abandoned, and that ecologists take a more critical approach to species?number relations and rely less on information theoretic and other analogies. As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or 'species composition parameters' having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach. The two most basic of these are simply ?1=[n/n?1][1?Σi(N\_i/\_N)2] =the proportion of potential interindividual encounters which is interspecific (as opposed to intraspecific), assuming every individual in the collection can encounter all other individuals, E(Sn) = Σi [1?(N?Nin)/(Nn)] =the expected number of species in a sample of n individuals selected at random from a collection containing N individuals, S species, and Ni individuals in the ith species.},
