	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Clustering of individuals into populations on the basis of multilocus genotypes is informative in a variety of settings. In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) ‘label switching’ of clusters across replicates, caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled, and (2) ‘genuine multimodality,’ truly distinct solutions across replicates.Results: To facilitate the interpretation of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP (CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100 replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.Availability:CLUMPP is freely available at http://rosenberglab.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu/clumpp.htmlContact:mjakob@umich.edu},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci\{{\textbackslash}textemdash\}e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

	abstract = {Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) adults are the smallest of the five Pacific salmon native to the western Pacific Ocean. Pink salmon are also the most abundant of these species and account for a large proportion of the commercial value of the salmon fishery worldwide. A two-year life history of pink salmon generates temporally isolated populations that spawn either in even-years or odd-years. To uncover the influence of this genetic isolation, reference genome assemblies were generated for each year-class and whole genome re-sequencing data was collected from salmon of both year-classes. The salmon were sampled from six Canadian rivers and one Japanese river. At multiple centromeres we identified peaks of Fst between year-classes that were millions of base-pairs long. The largest Fst peak was also associated with a million base-pair chromosomal polymorphism found in the odd-year genome near a centromere. These Fst peaks may be the result of a centromere drive or a combination of reduced recombination and genetic drift, and they could influence speciation. Other regions of the genome influenced by odd-year and even-year temporal isolation and tentatively under selection were mostly associated with genes related to immune function, organ development/maintenance, and behaviour.},

Distinct differences in standing pools of genetic variation were identified between the lineages; we observed higher levels of heterozygosity, allelic richness, and significantly more private alleles in the odd-year lineage. However, the patterns of population structure were concordant between lineages: the Asian and northern Alaska populations displayed little differentiation but differed significantly from populations in southcentral Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Our population structure results, in the context of known paleoecological information, suggest that both lineages occupied a northern Beringial refugium as well as a Cascadian refugium in North America during the Last Glacial Maximum. These results highlight the influence of historical patterns of habitat availability on contemporary population structure and support the hypothesis of a pre-glacial origin of the lineages.},

However, robust detection of selection in wild populations is difficult and often impeded by lack of replicate tests. Here, we investigate selection in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) using genome scans coupled with inference from a haploid-assisted linkage map. Pink salmon have a strict 2-year semelparous life history which has resulted in temporally isolated (allochronic) lineages that remain sympatric through sharing of spawning habitats in alternate years. The lineages differ in a range of adaptive traits, suggesting different genetic backgrounds. We used genotyping by sequencing of haploids to generate a high-density linkage map with 7035 loci and screened an existing panel of 8036 loci for signatures of selection. The linkage map enabled identification of novel genomic regions displaying signatures of parallel selection shared between lineages. Furthermore, 24 loci demonstrated divergent selection and differences in genetic diversity between lineages, suggesting that adaptation in the 2 lineages has arisen from different pools of standing genetic variation. Findings have implications for understanding asynchronous population abundances as well as predicting future ecosystem impacts from lineage-specific responses to climate change.},

Pink salmon, a highly abundant and widely ranging salmonid, provide a naturally occurring opportunity to study the effects of similar environments on divergent genetic backgrounds due to a strict two-year semelparous life history. The species is composed of two reproductively isolated lineages with overlapping ranges that share the same spawning and rearing environments in alternate years. We used restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to discover and genotype approximately 8000 SNP loci in three population pairs of even- and odd-year pink salmon along a latitudinal gradient in North America. We found greater differentiation within the odd-year than within the even-year lineage and greater differentiation in the southern pair from Puget Sound than in the northern Alaskan population pairs. We identified 15 SNPs reflecting signatures of parallel selection using both a differentiation-based method (BAYESCAN) and an environmental correlation method (BAYENV). These SNPs represent genomic regions that may be particularly informative in understanding adaptive evolution in pink salmon and exploring how differing genetic backgrounds within a species respond to selection from the same natural environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract Previous studies generally report that hatchery-origin Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) have lower relative reproductive success (RRS) than their natural-origin counterparts. We estimated the RRS of Pink Salmon (O. gorbuscha) in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska using incomplete pedigrees. In contrast to other RRS studies, Pink Salmon have a short freshwater life history, freshwater habitats in PWS are largely unaltered by development, and sampling was conducted without the aid of dams or weirs resulting in incomplete sampling of spawning individuals. Pink Salmon released from large-scale hatchery programs in PWS have interacted with wild populations for more than 15 generations. Hatchery populations were established from PWS populations but have subsequently been managed as separate broodstocks. Gene flow is primarily directional, from hatchery strays to wild populations. We used genetic-based parentage analysis to estimate the RRS of a single generation of stray hatchery-origin Pink Salmon in two streams, and across the odd- and even-year lineages. Despite incomplete sampling, we assigned 1745 offspring to at least one parent. Reproductive success (RS), measured as sampled adult offspring that returned to their natal stream, was significantly lower for hatchery- vs. natural-origin parents in both lineages, with RRS ranging from 0.03 to 0.47 for females and 0.05 to 0.86 for males. Generalized linear modeling for the even-year lineage indicated that RRS was lower for hatchery-origin fish, ranging from 0.42 to 0.60, after accounting for sample date (run timing), sample location within the stream, and fish length. Our results strongly suggest that hatchery-origin strays have lower fitness in the wild. The consequences of reduced RRS on wild productivity depend on whether the mechanisms underlying reduced RRS are environmentally driven, and likely ephemeral, or genetically driven, and likely persistent across generations.},

Surveys of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (O. keta) and sockeye (O. nerka) salmon in wild salmon spawning locations in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska since 1997 show a wide range of hatchery straying. The analysis of thermally marked otoliths collected from carcasses indicate that 0–98\% of pink salmon, 0–63\% of chum salmon and 0–93\% of sockeye salmon in spawning areas are hatchery fish, producing an unknown number of hatchery-wild hybrids. Most spawning locations sampled (77\%) had hatchery pink salmon from three or more hatcheries, and 51\% had annual escapements consisting of more than 10\% hatchery pink salmon during at least one of the years surveyed. An exponential decay model of the percentage of hatchery pink salmon strays with distance from hatcheries indicated that streams throughout PWS contain more than 10\% hatchery pink salmon. The prevalence of hatchery pink salmon strays in streams increased throughout the spawning season, while the prevalence of hatchery chum salmon decreased. The level of hatchery salmon strays in many areas of PWS are beyond all proposed thresholds (2–10\%), which confounds wild salmon escapement goals and may harm the productivity, genetic diversity and fitness of wild salmon in this region},

	abstract = {The 2009 Prince William Sound (PWS) management area (all coastal waters and inland drainages entering the north central Gulf of Alaska between Cape Suckling and Cape Fairfield) commercial salmon harvest was 24.5 million fish. The harvest was comprised of 19.1 million pink Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, 1.9 million sockeye O. nerka, 3.2 million chum O. keta, 300,615 coho O. kisutch, and 10,802 Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha. Approximately 64\% of the harvest, 15.8 million fish, was common property harvest and 8.77 million fish were sold for hatchery cost recovery. Homepack, educational permits, and donated fish accounted for less than one percent. Based on an informal survey of salmon processors in the PWS and Copper River area, the preliminary estimated value of the combined commercial salmon harvest was \$50.7 million, including hatchery sales. During the 2009 season, 511 drift gillnet, 27 set gillnet, and 154 purse seine permit holders fished. Drift gillnet exvessel harvest value was an estimated \$31.1 million, setting average permit earnings at \$61,000; set gillnet exvessel harvest value was an estimated \$1.7 million, setting average permit earnings at \$61,000; purse seine fishery exvessel harvest value was an estimated \$9.6 million, setting average permit earnings at \$62,000. Revenue generated for hatchery operations was approximately \$8.3 million. The PWS management area personal use and subsistence fisheries harvested a total of 145,000 fish. For these fisheries, approximately 9,800 subsistence and personal use permits were issued to Alaska residents. Sport fish permit holders landed an estimated 148,000 salmon in the PWS management area. The commercial Pacific herring Clupea pallasi fishery in the PWS management area was closed in 2009 for the tenth consecutive year because the spawning biomass remained below the 22,000 tons regulatory threshold.},

	abstract = {The extent to which stray, hatchery-reared salmon affect wild populations is much debated. Although experiments show that artificial breeding and culture influence the genetics of hatchery salmon, little is known about the interaction between hatchery and wild salmon in a natural setting. Here, we estimated historical and contemporary genetic population structures of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, with 135 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Historical population structure was inferred from the analysis of DNA from fish scales, which had been archived since the late 1960’s for several populations in PWS. Parallel analyses with microsatellites and a test based on Hardy-Weinberg proportions showed that about 50\% of the fish-scale DNA was cross-contaminated with DNA from other fish. These samples were removed from the analysis. We used a novel application of the classical source-sink model to compare SNP allele frequencies in these archived fish-scales (1964–1982) with frequencies in contemporary samples (2008–2010) and found a temporal shift toward hatchery allele frequencies in some wild populations. Other populations showed markedly less introgression, despite moderate amounts of hatchery straying. The extent of introgression may reflect similarities in spawning time and life-history traits between hatchery and wild fish, or the degree that hybrids return to a natal spawning area. The source-sink model is a powerful means of detecting low levels of introgression over several generations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Pacific salmon hatcheries support important commercial fisheries for Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and Chum Salmon O. keta in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska. State policy mandates that hatchery-produced fish must not negatively impact natural populations, which can occur during mixed fisheries and via ecological and genetic interactions. Therefore, we quantified the spatial and temporal overlap of natural- and hatchery-origin salmon (1) as they migrated into PWS and (2) in PWS spawning streams. Intensive sampling during 2013?2015, combined with ancillary agency harvest and hatchery composition data, also allowed us to estimate the hatchery, natural, and total run sizes. Estimated annual proportions (SE in parentheses) of hatchery fish in the preharvest run ranged from 0.55 (0.01) to 0.86 (0.03) for Pink Salmon and from 0.51 (0.03) to 0.73 (0.02) for Chum Salmon. Proportions of hatchery fish across all sampled PWS spawning streams were much lower, ranging from 0.05 (0.03) to 0.15 (0.07) for Pink Salmon and from 0.03 (0.03) to 0.09 (0.03) for Chum Salmon. In both species, relatively high instream proportions of hatchery fish tended to be geographically localized, while many streams exhibited low proportions. The estimated total PWS runs were 50?142 million Pink Salmon and 2.3?5.4 million Chum Salmon. Commercial fisheries harvested 94?99\% of hatchery-origin fish of both species, 27?50\% of natural-origin Pink Salmon, and 17?20\% of natural-origin Chum Salmon. Despite very high harvest rates on hatchery-produced fish, an estimated 0.8?4.5 million hatchery Pink Salmon and 30,000?90,000 hatchery Chum Salmon strayed into PWS spawning streams. Our findings provide context for further research on the relative productivity of hatchery- and natural-origin salmon spawning in streams, density-dependent survival, improvements in fidelity to hatchery release sites, the influence of hatchery production on escapement management and policy, and refinements in harvest management precision in PWS.},

On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation. Our methods adequately control type I error in large and small samples and are computationally efficient.

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

	abstract = {Abstract? Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data were obtained from pink salmon throughout Prince William Sound, Alaska, from two hatchery, five upstream, and 20 tidal locations distributed among five management regions collected during 1994. Screening for allozymes included 66 loci for 92 to 100 fish per sample. Thirty-four loci had variant allele frequencies {\textless}0.01 in one or more collections and were used for population analyses. Eight haplotypes were detected after screening 40 fish per collection for variation at the ND5/ND6 region of mtDNA using six restriction enzymes. Significant and apparently stable differences detected by both data sets permit rejecting a null hypothesis of panmixia and support managing native populations in Prince William Sound at the regional level. Distinctions between upstream and tidal collections were detected within Lagoon Creek (allozymes) and Koppen Creek (mtDNA). Significant regional heterogeneity was detected within upstream (allozymes and mtDNA) and tidal (allozymes) collections; however, upstream collections were more divergent from each other than were tidal collections. The absence of distinction of Armin F. Koernig Hatchery from almost all regions was consistent with multiple origins of this stock. Conversely, Solomon Gulch Hatchery in the East Region was distinct from all regions but East, consistent with a more restricted origin and influence.},

Although widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure?often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.},

We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy.

Many methods designed to detect FST outliers assume a specific model of demographic history, which can result in extremely high false positive rates for detecting loci under selection. We develop a new method that infers the distribution of FST for loci unlikely to be strongly affected by spatially diversifying selection, using data on a large set of loci with unknown selective properties.

A two-year life history of pink salmon generates temporally isolated populations that spawn either in even-years or odd-years. To uncover the influence of this genetic isolation, reference genome assemblies were generated for each year-class and whole genome re-sequencing data was collected from salmon of both year-classes. The salmon were sampled from six Canadian rivers and one Japanese river. At multiple centromeres we identified peaks of Fst between year-classes that were millions of base-pairs long. The largest Fst peak was also associated with a million base-pair chromosomal polymorphism found in the odd-year genome near a centromere. These Fst peaks may be the result of a centromere drive or a combination of reduced recombination and genetic drift, and they could influence speciation. Other regions of the genome influenced by odd-year and even-year temporal isolation and tentatively under selection were mostly associated with genes related to immune function, organ development/maintenance, and behaviour.},

We describe here a novel assembly-based approach to variant calling, the GATK HaplotypeCaller (HC) and Reference Confidence Model (RCM), that determines genotype likelihoods independently per-sample but performs joint calling across all samples within a project simultaneously. We show by calling over 90,000 samples from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that, in contrast to other algorithms, the HC-RCM scales efficiently to very large sample sizes without loss in accuracy; and that the accuracy of indel variant calling is superior in comparison to other algorithms. More importantly, the HC-RCM produces a fully squared-off matrix of genotypes across all samples at every genomic position being investigated. The HC-RCM is a novel, scalable, assembly-based algorithm with abundant applications for population genetics and clinical studies.},

In contrast to several previous estimators, the new estimator is well behaved and applies to any number of alleles per locus and any allele frequency distribution. The estimates for two- and four-gene coefficients of relatedness from the new estimator are unbiased irrespective of the sample size and have sampling variances decreasing consistently with an increasing number of alleles per locus to the minimum asymptotic values determined by the variation in identity-by-descent among loci per se, regardless of the actual relationship. The new estimator is also robust for small sample sizes and for unknown relatives being included in samples for estimating allele frequencies. Compared to previous estimators, the new one is generally advantageous, especially for highly polymorphic loci and/or small sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Analyses of pairwise relatedness represent a key component to addressing many topics in biology. However, such analyses have been limited because most available programs provide a means to estimate relatedness based on only a single estimator, making comparison across estimators difficult. Second, all programs to date have been platform specific, working only on a specific operating system. This has the undesirable outcome of making choice of relatedness estimator limited by operating system preference, rather than being based on scientific rationale. Here, we present a new R package, called related, that can calculate relatedness based on seven estimators, can account for genotyping errors, missing data and inbreeding, and can estimate 95\% confidence intervals. Moreover, simulation functions are provided that allow for easy comparison of the performance of different estimators and for analyses of how much resolution to expect from a given data set. Because this package works in R, it is platform independent. Combined, this functionality should allow for more appropriate analyses and interpretation of pairwise relatedness and will also allow for the integration of relatedness data into larger R workflows.},

We provide unphased implementations of iHS, nSL, XP-EHH, and XP-nSL and evaluate their performance across a range of important parameters in a generic demographic history. We also show that these implementations often outperform a naïve application of the original statistics to unphased data, and that they perform with minimal to no reduction in power compared to the original statistics when phase is perfectly known.

	abstract = {Abstract Effective population size (Ne) is a key parameter of population genetics. However, Ne remains challenging to estimate for natural populations as several factors are likely to bias estimates. These factors include sampling design, sequencing method, and data filtering. One issue inherent to the restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) protocol is missing data and SNP selection criteria (e.g., minimum minor allele frequency, number of SNPs). To evaluate the potential impact of SNP selection criteria on Ne estimates (Linkage Disequilibrium method) we used RADseq data for a nonmodel species, the thornback ray. In this data set, the inbreeding coefficient FIS was positively correlated with the amount of missing data, implying data were missing nonrandomly. The precision of Neestimates decreased with the number of SNPs. Mean Ne estimates (averaged across 50 random data sets with2000 SNPs) ranged between 237 and 1784. Increasing the percentage of missing data from 25\% to 50\% increased Ne estimates between 82\% and 120\%, while increasing the minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold from 0.01 to 0.1 decreased estimates between 71\% and 75\%. Considering these effects is important when interpreting RADseq data-derived estimates of effective population size in empirical studies.},

This analysis indicates that the new statistic will generally have a smaller variance than the others. Estimates of effective population sizes and of the standard errors of the estimates are computed for data on two fly populations that have been discussed in earlier papers. In both cases, there is evidence that the effective population size is very much smaller than the minimum census size of the population.},

It is shown that the standardized variance approximately follows the Χ2 distribution unless t is very large, and the confidence interval of the estimate of effective size can be obtained by using this property. Application of the formulae to data from an isolated population of Dacus oleae has shown that the effective size of this population is about one tenth of the minimum census size, though there was a possibility that the procedure of sampling genes was improper.},

Current methods for estimating the very recent historical Ne are unable to detect complex demographic trajectories involving multiple episodes of bottlenecks, drops, and expansions. We develop a theoretical and computational framework to infer the demographic history of a population within the past 100 generations from the observed spectrum of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of pairs of loci over a wide range of recombination rates in a sample of contemporary individuals. The cumulative contributions of all of the previous generations to the observed LD are included in our model, and a genetic algorithm is used to search for the sequence of historical Ne values that best explains the observed LD spectrum. The method can be applied from large samples to samples of fewer than ten individuals using a variety of genotyping and DNA sequencing data: haploid, diploid with phased or unphased genotypes and pseudohaploid data from low-coverage sequencing. The method was tested by computer simulation for sensitivity to genotyping errors, temporal heterogeneity of samples, population admixture, and structural division into subpopulations, showing high tolerance to deviations from the assumptions of the model. Computer simulations also show that the proposed method outperforms other leading approaches when the inference concerns recent timeframes. Analysis of data from a variety of human and animal populations gave results in agreement with previous estimations by other methods or with records of historical events.},

Here, we provide evidence for a selective sweep creating an island of divergence associated with reproductive behavior in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), identifying a series of linked single nucleotide polymorphisms across a {\textasciitilde}22,733 basepair region spanning the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 9 gene exhibiting signatures of divergent selection associated with stream- and shore-spawning in both anadromous and resident forms across their pan-Pacific distribution. This divergence likely occurred {\textasciitilde}3.8 Mya (95\% HPD = 2.1–6.03 Mya), after sockeye separated from pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon, but prior to the Pleistocene glaciations. Our results suggest recurrent evolution of reproductive ecotypes across the native range of O. nerka is at least partially associated with divergent selection of pre-existing genetic variation within or linked to this region. As sockeye salmon are unique among Pacific salmonids in their flexibility to spawn in lake-shore benthic environments, this region provides great promise for continued investigation of the genomic basis of O. nerka life history evolution, and, more broadly, for increasing our understanding of the heritable basis of adaptation of complex traits in novel environments.},
